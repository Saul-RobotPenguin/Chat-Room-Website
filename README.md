A Chat Room Web App that integrates messaging functionality using Socket.IO !
## Description
A Chat Room Web Application that I built using Socket.IO and the Express framework for the backend functionality.
Ever wondered how messaging works?
Like that's the process of sending a message and the process of receiving one as well?

Well I did!

So I started experimenting and managed to build my own Chat Room Website!

Anyone can come in and say whatever they want (Unfortunately T~T)

So give it a try and send a message like "Saul is Awesome" or "Saul's My Role Model!" using the link located underneath the Demo Section of this README.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Saul-RobotPenguin/Chatty.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Chatty/
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```
or

```bash
  npm i
```

Start the server

```bash
 npm start
```

Last but not least, if you're providing a separate Port then use that one. 
If not then simply navigate to http://localhost:3000/
